circuit-lang
============

A project to bring a code-like abstraction layer to circuitry in the similar way to how programming languages have to machine code.

##Current progress

Currently I am writing the proof of concept in C++, this includes an EBNF interpreter and hopefully later syntax tree generator. I plan to use this to prototype the syntax for the language, past this not much is planned.
